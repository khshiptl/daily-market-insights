# Daily Market Insights

This project builds an automated data pipeline that collects, processes, and tracks daily stock market performance for multiple companies using Python, Pandas, and GitHub Actions.  
It demonstrates how to automate data workflows and maintain continuous data quality through version control and CI/CD practices.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to design a scalable and automated analytics pipeline that captures daily stock data and appends it to a historical dataset.  
Using **GitHub Actions**, the pipeline runs automatically every 24 hours to:

- Extract market data for selected stock symbols using `yfinance`.  
- Transform and clean the dataset for consistency.  
- Append new records to an existing historical log (`daily_summary.csv`).  
- Commit and push updates back to the repository automatically.

This approach simulates a lightweight, cloud-based CI/CD workflow for data analytics and governance.

## Objectives

- Automate data collection and logging of daily market trends.  
- Maintain historical stock data for long-term analysis.  
- Practice CI/CD automation and data pipeline design using GitHub Actions.  
- Apply data governance concepts such as version control and audit tracking.

## Process

1. **Data Extraction**  
   - Collects the latest hourly data for selected stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META) using the Yahoo Finance API.  

2. **Transformation & Cleaning**  
   - Converts raw prices into a structured format and calculates percent change.  
   - Removes duplicate entries and sorts data chronologically.  

3. **Loading & Logging**  
   - Appends results to `data/daily_summary.csv`.  
   - Automatically commits and pushes updates to the repository.  

4. **Automation**  
   - Scheduled daily run via GitHub Actions using a `.yml` workflow file.  
   - Each run logs activity under the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù tab for full transparency.
